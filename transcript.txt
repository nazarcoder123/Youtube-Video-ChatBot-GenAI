~0~Welcome back to my Roblox beginner ~1~scripting tutorial guide. My name is ~2~Balddev and in this episode we'll be ~4~discussing about printing. So in the ~6~last episode we covered the basics of ~9~navigating around Roblox Studio and what ~11~Roblox Studio has to offer for us that's ~13~going to be important for this entire ~15~tutorial guide. So for things like ~17~moving around inside of Roblox Studio, ~19~also showing you the services that ~21~Roblox has to offer for us, the explorer ~23~panel, and also the properties panel ~24~that we're going to be using throughout ~26~this entire tutorial guide. Now that we ~28~have that understanding, uh, for the ~30~rest of this tutorial guide, I'm going ~31~to be introducing to you concepts ~34~relating to scripting. Now, to basically ~37~explain what scripting is, it's an ~39~aspect of game development that allows ~41~you to add functionality to your games ~44~that you're creating on Roblox. So, the ~46~other aspects of game development are ~48~things like building, like we just did ~50~right here. Um, maybe even things like ~52~modeling and also, um, UI designing and ~55~all of these other sorts of things. ~57~Scripting is a component of game ~59~development that allows you to add ~60~functionality to your game. An example I ~62~can think of this is this spawn location ~64~right here. So making the spawn location ~67~itself requires building. But actually ~69~making it functional requires scripting. ~72~So if my character were to join into the ~74~game, then we need to tell Roblox that ~77~we need to spawn on this spawn location. ~79~And if our character dies, then we need ~81~to respawn back onto this spawn ~83~location. that is what adds ~85~functionality to the spawn location ~86~rather than it just being some random ~88~part inside of the game. So that ~90~requires scripting to be able to um ~93~essentially tell Roblox that we want ~95~this uh spawn location to function the ~98~way it is because of it. And we add ~100~functionality through scripts. Now, to ~103~explain what a script is, it's basically ~105~a document or a piece of paper that has ~108~a list of instructions or commands that ~111~basically tells Roblox to execute these ~113~commands when we join into the game or ~115~when a specific thing happens inside of ~117~the game. And so, when we write these ~119~scripts, it's very important for us to ~121~write it in a very specific way so that ~124~Roblox can read these commands and they ~126~can interpret it so they can understand ~128~it, finally execute them inside of our ~130~game. Because this is one of the biggest ~132~things new developers get confused with ~134~and that is being able to uh get the ~136~syntax down like understanding the rules ~138~and guidelines when it comes to um ~140~writing these commands because they fall ~143~under a programming language called Lua ~145~or Lua uh for Roblox. And so when we ~149~understand this language then we're able ~150~to write commands effectively and tell ~153~Roblox to execute certain commands ~156~within our scripts. So, let's actually ~158~create our first script. And we're going ~160~to be adding this inside of the ~162~explorer. And there's two places that ~163~are popular for scripts. The first one ~165~is the workspace, and the second one is ~168~the server script service. But for this ~170~episode, we're going to add a script ~172~inside of workspace. And there's there's ~174~a couple ways you can add objects inside ~176~of a folder. One way is to hit this plus ~179~sign that's next to workspace. So, I'm ~180~going to click on this, and there should ~182~be a list full of all of these um ~184~objects that we can put inside of this ~186~folder. So, what I'm going to do is say ~189~script inside of the search bar. And ~191~there's three scripts, but for the sake ~193~of this tutorial, we're just going to be ~195~using the normal script. So, I'm just ~196~going to click on this. And now we have ~199~inserted a script inside of our ~202~workspace. And you might have also ~203~noticed that our screen has changed to ~206~be inside of this script editor. And we ~210~can revert back to the game if we want ~211~to by hitting down this tab right here. ~214~So, we are now back into the normal ~215~game. And if we want to go back into the ~217~script, then we just simply click on the ~219~script so that we can pull up the script ~221~editor again. And when we open up the ~223~script for the first time, Roblox is ~224~going to add a default um command here ~228~that simply just says print hello world. ~230~Now, it might be a little hard to read ~232~for you. So, what I want you to do is ~234~hit control and then move the mouse ~236~scroll wheel inward so that you can zoom ~238~in. Um, but I'm already zoomed in pretty ~240~well, so if you need to do that, then ~241~you can do that very quickly. So for ~243~this first scripting episode, what I'm ~246~going to show you how to do is write ~248~these print statements. Now what is a ~250~print statement? A print statement is ~251~basically a command that allows us to ~254~write a message to an output window so ~257~that we can see it uh when we run the ~260~game. Now, in order to know where this ~262~output window is, what we need to do is ~264~go back into the game, hit on the view ~267~tab, and we're going to click on this ~268~button that says output. So if we click ~270~on this then we can see this window down ~273~here that shows our um our print ~276~statements and also our logs as well. ~278~That's the whole point of the output ~279~window. It's so that we can see whatever ~281~we put inside of here show up down here ~284~when we join into the game. So if we go ~286~into the game, we can actually test this ~288~out for ourselves. The way we do that is ~290~by hitting on this test tab up here and ~292~then we click on this button that says ~294~play. So if we click on this then what's ~296~going to happen is first of all our our ~298~character actually loads into the game ~300~and we can play this game normally as if ~302~this was a Roblox game. Um but also down ~305~here we can see in the output it says ~308~hello world which was our message and we ~310~can actually click on um the script that ~313~executed this command and it's going to ~315~show us the script and also the line of ~318~where our print message executed. So ~321~this print statement is basically a ~323~print command that tells Roblox that we ~326~want to print this message down here ~329~inside of this output so that we can see ~331~it for ourselves. And we can write our ~333~own print statements as well um rather ~336~than having Roblox's default print ~338~message right over here. So what we can ~340~do is actually delete this print ~342~statement so that we can write our own ~343~print statement. So what I'm going to do ~345~is hold down the backspace so that it ~348~basically deletes all the lines of code ~349~that um was over here. So we are on line ~353~number one and now let's add in our ~355~first print statement. Now one quick ~358~thing I want to mention is that when we ~360~are writing our scripts it's very case ~363~sensitive and what that means is you ~365~have to be very specific with how you ~367~write stuff inside of the script. So ~369~some things can be uppercase, some ~370~things can be lowercase. And it's very ~372~important that we understand when it is ~374~uppercase and when it's lowerase. So now ~376~let's write our print statement. We're ~377~simply going to say in all lowercase, ~379~we're going to say print p r i n t and ~383~then what we're going to do is type the ~385~open parenthesis. So we're going to ~387~press shift 9. And then we're also going ~389~to put in the double quotations. So ~391~we're going to say shift apostrophe. And ~393~so now we can write whatever message we ~396~want inside of these quotations. So we ~398~can say something as simple as hello ~401~just like this with an exclamation mark. ~403~And there we go. This is our very first ~406~print statement that we have going on ~407~right over here. We can test this by ~409~going into the game and hitting play. So ~411~as we can see in the output, it indeed ~414~printed our message with hello. Now, I ~417~forgot to mention really quickly that uh ~418~when we're playing the game inside of ~420~Roblox Studio, like we hit play, uh in ~423~order for us to stop play testing, uh we ~425~go up here and then just simply hit the ~427~stop button. I forgot to mention this ~428~because I do it out of instinct. So, I ~430~apologize about that. Um so, what we're ~432~going to do is hit stop. And now we are ~434~back into Roblox Studio. So, now let's ~437~go back to our script. And we can ~438~actually add more print statements on ~440~top of this print statement. So, what ~441~we're going to do is drop a line by ~443~hitting enter. And as you can see, we ~445~are now on line number two. So we can ~448~write our print statement just like uh ~450~we did the first time by saying print ~452~open parenthesis and we're going to say ~455~double quotations. And we can continue ~457~what we were saying before by saying how ~459~are you doing question mark just like ~462~this. So now we have two print ~464~statements. If we go into the game and ~466~hit play, then what we should see in the ~468~output is two of our print statements ~470~instead of just one. So, it's going to ~472~start with hello and then it's going to ~474~say how are you doing? So, if we hit ~475~stop and then we go into the script, we ~478~can continue this chain of print ~479~statements if we want to. Uh, we can go ~482~and hit enter and then we can write ~484~another print statement by saying print ~486~open parenthesis double quotations and ~488~then I can say I'm doing very well ~493~exclamation mark. So now we have three ~495~print statements and you can continue ~496~going down the script editor and just ~498~keep adding more and more print ~500~statements if you want to do that. Um ~502~because you can make this as long as you ~503~want to. Like there's like you have the ~505~power to make as many print statements ~507~as you want. Like if we go back into the ~508~game and hit play then as you can see in ~510~the output it's going to display the ~512~three print messages that we just ~513~created. Now you don't have to worry ~515~about the syntax for right now. That's ~516~going to be explained in a future ~517~episode. But what I want you to do is I ~520~literally want you to type exactly what ~522~I'm typing here so that you get the feel ~524~for knowing how to implement this stuff ~526~inside of Roblox Studio and so that ~527~you're getting the experience alongside ~530~me as we go through these scripting ~531~episodes. So that's basically going to ~533~be it for this episode. What I want you ~535~to do for today's learning objective is ~537~to continue this story of like you know ~539~these three print statements. You could ~540~just continue down here by writing ~542~another print statement or if you want ~544~you can delete all of these print ~546~statements and write your own story or ~548~whatever it is you want to create. So ~550~you can just delete the entire thing and ~551~then you can start back from square one ~552~if you want to. It's really up to you ~554~with what you want to do. Now, after you ~555~do this, what I encourage you to do is ~557~take your print statements, go down to ~559~the comment section of this video, and ~560~then paste it so that other viewers can ~562~see um your poem or your message or ~565~whatever it is that you're comfortable ~566~sharing uh to everybody else because I ~568~just think it would be very fun to see ~570~what everybody's doing for these ~571~challenges. So, go ahead and do that uh ~574~once you finish with this learning ~575~objective. And one more thing before we ~577~end off this video. If you get stuck at ~579~any point throughout this tutorial ~580~guide, I have a Discord server which you ~582~can go into to ask questions and get ~585~help for your scripts if you want ~587~through the link in the description. So, ~588~if you're interested, then feel free to ~589~join my Discord server to get help while ~591~you go through this tutorial guide. So, ~593~that's pretty much going to be it for ~594~this tutorial guide. I hope you enjoyed ~595~it and I will see you in the next ~597~episode. Take care.
